# PortMaster - Tunic
This port runs on Retroid Pocket 5 with wine64 and box64. It has been tested with RockNIX. To install, copy the port directory `tunic` and `Tunic.sh` file to your `ports` folder, and then copy your `Tunic` game data into `tunic/data`.

You need `wine-mono` and `dxvk` dependencies. The launchscript installs dxvk for you if it doesn't exist already, and you will be prompted if you need `wine-mono`.
